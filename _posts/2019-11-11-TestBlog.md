## Memo
Writing research blogs is a habbit that I want to build long long time ago. However, due to many reasons (the biggest one is that I'm too lazy, haha) I haven't insist such good habit. I would like to keep notes on private note apps rather than make it public. 

From now on, I hope I could make a change.

To write down the research ideas or thoughts that flashed when reading papers to share it on the Internet.
