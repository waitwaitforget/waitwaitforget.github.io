I am a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science at Fudan University. I received my Bachelorâ€™s in Mathematics from East China University of Science and Technology. Currently I'm a visiting scholar in Prof. Jianping Fan's lab at UNC Charlotte.

I mainly focus on representation learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. I am also interested in deep generative models, and in its application to semi-supervised learning.

I'm looking for internship in Shanghai since Oct. 2018.
