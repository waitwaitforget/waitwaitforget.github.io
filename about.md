I am a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science at Fudan University supervised by Prof. [Shuigeng Zhou](http://admis.fudan.edu.cn/). I received my Bachelorâ€™s in Mathematics from East China University of Science and Technology. Currently I'm a visiting scholar in Prof. [Jianping Fan](https://webpages.uncc.edu/jfan/)'s lab at UNC Charlotte.

I mainly focus on representation learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. I am also interested in deep generative models, and in its application to semi-supervised learning.

I'm looking for internship in Shanghai since Oct. 2018.
